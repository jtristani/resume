## Experience

**Sr. Software Engineer - Lead**  
ReliaQuest | July 2021 – Present

#### Designed & led the engineering of a content management system for the GreyMatter platform  

The GreyMatter platform is composed of over 200 microservices with user generated content scattered across multiple of these services. The Content Management team engineered a first-party solution to not only version content through an integration with a new global content service, but also distribute Global content and configuration across the different GreyMatter regions.

#### Implemented the **Ray** (ray.io) framework to train/host internal and open-source models

As part of an AI driven product pipeline, led the implementation of Ray infrastructure & CI pipelines to train multiple internal ML models, ranging from fine-tuned LLMs, embedding, and classifier models for internal use cases. Designed a region agnostic solution to route traffic to models hosted in multiple regions to provide High-Availability and allieviate compute constraints in regions.

#### Mentoring others

Onboarded and mentored associates into the GreyMatter platform, explained core services, functionalities and concepts. Led and mentored interns with the creation of an internal developer CLI for interacting with developer environments and the creation of a classical machine learning classification model to improve existing approaches in reducing the alert noise and fatigue, and close incidents based on the included artifacts.

#### Developing AI integration services on the core GreyMatter platform

Contributed in creating the initial set of AI specific services for interacting with LLMs; services centered around the creation of a prompt management service for the compilation of system prompts to be executed by an internal service for interfacing with multiple LLM providers.

#### Contributions as part of the Platform team

- Improved platform libraries for microservice architecture.
- Led transition to JWT-based authentication with Auth0.
- Enhanced scalability using Kafka for a multi-stage data pipeline.
